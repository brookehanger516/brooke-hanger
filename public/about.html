          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p class="narrative-text">
            My career path has been anything but linear—and that's by design. With a 
            <strong>B.A. in International Affairs</strong> from James Madison University 
            and fluency in <strong>three languages</strong> (English, Spanish, Chinese), 
            I've built a career at the intersection of technology, human services, and business growth.
          </p>
          <p class="narrative-text">
            From closing <strong>GPU and cloud infrastructure deals</strong> as an Account Executive 
            at Cloud Compute to leading <strong>300+ client programs</strong> as Assistant Director 
            at ACANY, I've learned that the best solutions emerge when you combine technical expertise 
            with deep empathy for the people you serve. Whether I'm optimizing CRM pipelines, 
            teaching political science as an Adjunct Professor, or founding my own wellness agency, 
            the common thread is clear: <strong>consultative problem-solving that drives measurable results</strong>.

            <h3>Revenue Through Relationships</h3>
            <p>
              I don't just sell products—I solve problems. By deeply understanding client 
              needs and aligning solutions to their goals, I've increased conversion rates 
              by <strong>30%</strong> through consultative selling.

              Whether it's streamlining Salesforce pipelines, reducing compliance gaps by 
              <strong>35%</strong> in care management, or building wellness programs from scratch, 
              I design solutions that scale and sustain.

            <p>
              From nonprofit leadership to bilingual client support, I bring a service mindset 
              to every role—ensuring technology serves people, not the other way around.

          <p class="about-narrative">
            When I'm not architecting cloud solutions or mentoring teams, you'll
            find me exploring the Pacific Northwest's incredible hiking trails,
            contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying Seattle's vibrant
            coffee culture. I'm passionate about
            <strong>technology education</strong> and regularly speak at
            conferences and mentor aspiring engineers.
          </p>
          <p class="about-narrative">
            I believe in giving back to the community that shaped my
            career—whether through <strong>technical writing</strong>,
            <strong>conference talks</strong>, or
            <strong>pro-bono consulting</strong> for startups with promising
            missions.
